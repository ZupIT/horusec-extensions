For horusec to analyze the code of the current workspace, it is necessary to open the command palette (`ctrl + shift + p or click on view and select the Command Palette option`) and type the command `Horusec Start`.

After executing the command, a notification will appear informing you that the analysis has started, also when the analysis is finished.

The results will be presented in a file and in the code with the probable vulnerability.
