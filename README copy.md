This project is an extension for visual studio code of the horusec security analysis tool.

## What is Horusec?
Horusec is an open source tool that improves identification of vulnerabilities in your project with just one command.

### For more details see our [DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.horusec.io)

## Usage

### Requirements for using horusec
* docker

### Running Horusec

For horusec to analyze the code of the current workspace, it is necessary to open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd>) and type the command `Horusec Start`.

After executing the command, a notification will appear informing you that the analysis has started, also when the analysis is finished.

The results will be presented in a file and in the code with the probable vulnerability.
